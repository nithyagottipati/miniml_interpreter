I implemented a small subset of an Ocaml-like language called MiniMl including only a subset of constructs and limited support for types without type inference. I implemented three models of MiniMl using the substitution model (eval_s), a dynamically scoped environment model (eval_d) and, finally, a lexically scoped environment model as my extension (eval_l). The substitution model was lexically scoped. It "purely" handles all the initial subset of constructs we were given.
